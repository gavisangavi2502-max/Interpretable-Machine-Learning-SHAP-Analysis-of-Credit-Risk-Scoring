# Interpretable-Machine-Learning-SHAP-Analysis-of-Credit-Risk-Scoring
This project focuses on building a high-performance credit-risk classifier and applying SHAP for interpretability. You will train a non-linear model, compute global and local SHAP values, analyze high-risk vs low-risk customer profiles, and provide insights explaining key drivers of loan default risk.
